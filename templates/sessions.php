<h1>Sessions</h1>

<p>Here you should be able to manage your sessions and terminate them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to programmers shortage, we were not able to complete this part that should feed from Keycloak APIs.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you can manage sessions from the <a href="https://sso.weeeopen.it/auth/realms/weeeopen/account/sessions">Keycloak Account management panel</a> instead.</p>
